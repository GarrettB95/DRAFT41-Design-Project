# DRAFT41-Design-Project
My Design Project for DRAFT41 at Chaffey College.
For DRAFT41 I decided to do a design an omni-directional wheel. There are many ways to make one as well as how one is driven, and in this case I decided to utilize helical gears that will turn smaller wheels set about the rim of a larger, conventional wheel. The larger wheel can be driven through usually common means (via belt, chain, gear, etc. In this case, I chose a belt.) and the helical gears are to be driven by identical means, however power is transmitted through a different load path (the aforementioned smaller wheels) allowing the entire assembly to rotate conventionally, or translate left to right, or a combination of both. For prototyping purposes, 3D printing is the primary method in which the parts in this assembly are manufactured, while other standardized hardware is used with minimal, if any, edits to its geometry.
